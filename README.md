Here is the code for collaborative drawing machine I made.
You can run the app with this link https://drawing-machine.herokuapp.com/
Everyone who opens the link at the same time can make a drawing together on the same canvas. Shapes will appear when mouse is dragged. You have the option to
draw laser beams or stars by selecting them from the buttons on the top. The slider changes the width of the laser beams.
